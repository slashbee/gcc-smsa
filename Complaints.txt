No action has been taken since 2015 . My aged parents are suffering every year during the rainfall season . Our area has all the top people living like actor Sharath Kumar, IAS officers, IPS officers etc . Their street have rain water drain available , why is it not available to our street, which is few streets away from their houses . Why is that we should suffer every year ? Why is that no action is taken ? . No proper road facility also  for our street.  ? Will it be rectified atleast this year .

The downward sloping of Balakrishnan Road and 16th Cross Street have been causing all rain water to flow into 14th cross street which has a slight decline and the Corporation Playground is slowly getting filled with water. Yesterday the Metro Water Officials temporarily resolved the overflowing drainage issue but were not sure how long it will hold. The rain water needs to be directed towards 4th seaward road since it is equipped with storm water drains. The playground had been a saviour but now after development it has become and bane and holds water for mosquitos to breed and sewage to emanate stench.

The bus stand tarmac is totally inundated. Over 75 lakhs was spent on renovating the bus terminus using the MLA's fund during his last term. We were expecting tarmac will be be flushed with the road.
This subway was renovated over a period of 8 to 9 months. The height of the tarmac should have been increased given the long history of water logging.
There has been a long history of water logging in the above streets and we have been reporting it for several years.  Provide a long-term solution by reconstructing the Water Canal on PH Road.

All platforms in adyar shastri nagar area have been encroached and are being used for mechanic works, car parks, bike parks, buttermilk shops and road sidr eateries. People honk on their bikes to make you move aside when walking on these side walks coz they believe that it is their parking and in RAINY DAYS we cannot walk on road as there is water and since these sidewalks are encroached we have no other option but to walk on the middle of road to avoid water...majority 80% of the footpaths on that road are useless as they are taken over by shops or electricity boxes and water always gets clogged there..

Road Laying Issue 
The roads have been dug, for the past 2 months! They close, dig again the same route, close, dig again. Absolute lack of planning. 
And after closing the roads, the roads are not laid again, and worse, they are not even compacted. The roads are a huge huge pile of sand dumped in the center and looks like riding a dirt bike everyday. 

Now every side is dug - manapakkam main road, road towards kolapakkam, road towards mugaliwakkam, towards ips colony. And all roads are in bad condition. 

The traffic condition due to road block and the road situation is very bad and there are no traffic police to regulate it too. 

It's been this way for 2 months and still not one proper road, not one route where the work is fully done, and roads are properly laid. It takes 2 to 3 kms detour to reach places that are just 500m away, due to diversions and it takes 45 min to 1 hour to travel 500 to 600m in car, due to road condition and traffic.

This complaint is on behalf of the  residents from Munusamy Street, venkatesh Nagar main road. Back side of jayagopal karodia school.

This water is stagnant for more than a month now. We have notice white snake in the water Today. This ground is misused big time. Used as a dumping area for garbage and wastages.

SISTER PRIYA  & COMMISSIONER SIR

Ever since I started residing 15+ years at sahaj enclave in Manapakkam Ramachandra Colony, I’ve not seen a single higher official of Greater Chennai Corporation visiting or taking consideration of the grievances of the people of this locality. All was natural but good until a month ago. A canal as pure for rain water is now illegally ditch water flowing from neighbouring locality by breaking the barrier flow. Is there a person who can visit for yourself & take steps for the betterment.

Mainly to avoid mosquito deceases.

PRAY THE WORSHIP MAYOR @priya & RESPECTFUL CM @mkstalin
Sri Sai Enterprises, an RO water company operating in Nelkukunram Reddy Street, Chennai, is distributing drinking water without properly cleaning RO drinking water cans bought by people in an unsanitary manner.

Dear Sir / Madam, 
The above picture is the present condition of 6th Cross Street, South Jagannatha Nagar, Villivakkam. This falls under zone VIII ward 94. I am Sam a resident of Plot No. 19 of the above mentioned.
Sewage water that oozes out of the drain is stagnant on the road and is also a high thereat of infecious disease. 
This issue is due to lack of Strom water drains. Please note that this street is sloped downward to the northern side of the road and the road is higher in the southern side. The corporation has provided Strom water drains in the southern side of the street where the road is higher but failed to provide the same in northern side where the road is low. This results in water stagnation on the road in addition to this overflow flow from sewerage during rains create unhealthy surrounding paving ways to infection  while metro water (CMWSSB) people are addressing the over flow issues regularly whereas the corporation had not planned Strom water drains without taking cognition of the water flow direction and the highs and lows of the streets.

So they built the storm water drain like this in front of the gate. They wouldn’t slope it down. There’s a drain right in front and I have no idea how to solve this problem. Others are constructing a slope that encroaches on the road and the solution to prevent Blocking the drain is to have a hollow underneath so water can drain which starts to create lot more problem than solution. Seems like a half ass job that puts the onus on residents to solve for getting their vehicles out.
 non burning of street lights.

We regret to inform you about the deplorable, unhygienic condition our street corner at Kuberan Nagar 12th Street Extension, Madipakkam which is a residential area. A lot of garbage construction materials, medical waste, meat waste, etc. is thrown on the road in the vacant land and besides to it the garbage-bin kept near the road is always filled. Lorries dump lot of above rubbish materials in the midnight when none is awake, and this is an ongoing story for last 6 months. I had personally raised complaints to the Chennai Corporation thru online but the officials just call and inform that they would clear it but it is not cleared or solution provided by even the conservancy Inspector . When checked the online complaint status it states that the complaint raised is closed , you cannot reinitiate it as the time has elapsed in one day’s time.

Sir we residence from first main road Seethammal colony Alwarpet Chennai 600018 having difficulties because of the diversion because of metro rail. At the corner of our road junction there is a road side food and vegetable shops because of there shops footpath is jam. The people who come to eat they are harassing our residents ladies. Plz help us to clear the shops. Thanks.
Sir,


Sub:- Encroachment at  Busy Intersection. 
 
Place: Junction of Dr. Besant Road & Shaik Dawood Street,  Royapettah.
             Comes in Zone – IX   Division: 115    
 
This street width is 25 to 30 feet. The above said junction width was already reduced due to the Electric Transformer erection. Add to this Storm Water Drain built next to EB transformer. Now the available width is 15 to 20 feet for public use. More vehicles pass every day using this junction. 
As this junction is the Entry and Exit for more than 30 streets inside. 
 
On the Electric Transformer side, during Day and night-time very Bravely one person has the shop, with a table and chairs and a foldable Umbrella. DAY: Fish Shop, NIGHT: Chicken Snacks shop. Not on the platform or Footpath. Very centre of the road.
 
Add to this at the exact opposite side near the MGR statue during daytime one person selling Tender coconut in the vehicle. 
 
Now the available road width for public use is 10 feet only. 
 
How does our system allow this illegal Encroachment?  
 
As it poses a severe traffic hurdle here. Because of this, at any day vehicle drivers will fight each other for space to pass this point. 
 
Please take the necessary action. And do the needful for a permanent stop to this Encroachment.

As General Public is having high priority to using the Road space for movement. 
Allowing someone to run a shop in that space is unfair and makes the life of the common man very difficult. 

On this spot the Storm water drain was built on the Road instead of platform.  Because of the Electric transformer erected on the platform.  Now the encroacher very comfortably occupying this space to run his business day and night. 

Hope action will be taken within a reasonable time and no further encroachment is possible in the future in this spot. 

Thanks

Mohammed Abdul.
And residents of Shaik Dawood Street.

Furthermore, the construction debris has yet to be cleared away.

Furthermore, other shelters have been discarded in the vicinity This is an egregious disregard for the community's needs and must be rectified.

ஒவ்வொரு வருடமும் இந்த சாலையில் மழைநீர் முழங்கால் அளவுக்கு நிற்கிறது.கடந்த வருடம் செய்த பணிகள் பாதியில் கிடப்பில் போடப்படுள்ளது.இந்த முக்கிய சாலையில் மழைநீர் வடிகால் விரைந்து போடப்படுமா? வைத்தியநாதன் தெரு, தண்டையார்பேட்டை.

Dear Madam, 

I m a resident of Anna Nagar, but I doubt whether greater Chennai corporation has included this region within city limits? 

Because in the 7 th main road buffalo, cows, dogs, cattle of all types roam around freely without needing any restrictions also this region people steal electricity for their various partying purposes more illegal practices are done here 
The coovam river bed is used by anti social people for drugs and alcohol parties 

At the entrance of this place people park their vehicles one after the other leaving no space for road commuters 

Ther is also drainage leakage in this road 

People have constructed shops and taken illegal electricity connections 
The houses in this locality is affected by heavy voltage fluctuations please check this location and do the needful

Will you take strict action against your zone 7 officials? I doubt!
my earlier complaint regarding removal of non-standard speed breakers put up at Nehru nagar main road,ward155,tweeted on 19 April 23 has not yet been looked into.
Inspite of my complaints on 28 th February regarding 132 division encroachments on station view road & Akbarabad 2 nd street with pictures , no action taken yet . Kabab shop at the corner of Akbarabad 2 nd st is very dangerous .
after L&T started working. All there workers are throwing rubbish & garbage directly on road. Kindly take action against this. 
Location : Madhavaram (200 feet Inner Ring Road).

Hello Chennai Corp team, this is the condition of LB Road. It has been more than 2 months and we are riding in such a risky space.
Dn 19 ZN 2 St no. 114. Burst of cotton & seeds from the tree located in the Stno 114. No response from the officials inspite of complaints for the last 10 days. Reckless attitude of AE concerned.Lot of inconvenience & pollution. Health of children affected.
Dn 19 ZN 2  near door no 4191 , 35 th St. MMDA MATHUR. Tree precariously standing. No response from the offcials inspite of complaints . Attitude of AE needs to be checked. Request intervention

A big heap of mud has been placed in the middle of the street for more than2 weeks now,its not yet been http://cleared.It is very challenging and stressful for the people and kids.

Milling and Scrapping of Roads are not done properly (snap attached) due to which vehicles are parked on the storm water drain platform. Storm water drains holes are completely blocked. Ensure proper milling before roads are laid. Div.162 Alandur, Thiruvalluvar Nagar Main Road.

Please have a look at interior roads and main roads of pulianthope like Pulianthope high road, Natcharammal St, Ammaiyammal St, etc., All these roads are damaged due to other water, drainage connections and especially storm water drain work which has just completed.
It's very unfortunate the obstructions are back on the footpath within a few days.

Dear Sir/Madam,

My name is Sharad, resident of 7th cross st, extn, Thiruvalluvar Nagar. Zone 13, Ward 180. 

I would like to bring to your notice that, our streets have now become a public toilet for local shop keepers and public. Cars parked in the streets are a easy hideout for the public to urinate and excrement. 

There is a huge park in the street and there are multiple incidents where public openly soil the streets when kids are playing around. 

I have tried my best to keep the place clean and ask public not to urinate. I humbly request you to help us sorting this issue out.

Sir, The EB Dept has dug the roads of Krishnapuram Street and Bajanai Koil Street in Choolaimedu, Chennai 94 for laying cables and they have not closed the area that has been dug. Due to this 30% of the the road width that runs across 700 meters approx cannot be used and this leads to traffic congestion and frequent two wheeler accidents. Also residents are not able to take their car out of the apartments. We have raised an online complaint but no action taken till date. We have informed the Councillor as well. It would be great if necessary action is taken by the Corporation /EB officials.

Either tree branches have to be trimmed or restrict high vehicle.  Today I got escaped in a thin chance with 2 kids on the way to school.  Request immediate action on this dangerous situation.  Thanks
Hello GCC, there are so many stray dogs roaming around in Mogappair East (especially Justice Rathinavel Pandian Rd). It is very unsafe for kids & passers-by.

ey Guys, 

I am not sure if you would see this. 

Avai Sanmugam Salai, particularly the area in front of DAV boys school, Gopalapuram is messed up because of recent digging. 

Today when I was crossing that area, there was heavy traffic as it was school time. 

I saw an elderly man who was riding his cycle and trying to avoid the bad areas of the road, but unfortunately the cycle's wheel slipped into a crack  (in the bad area) and he lost balance and fell flat sideways. It did seem like his head was hurt, I am not sure. Everyone came to his assistance. 

But it was a truly pathetic site to see. 

Rectify the same. Thank you.

This is in the road between Blue Cross and Old KFI (current HCL school coming up in that campus). Since they raised the height of the school, water is unable to flow and stagnates in the road making it inaccessible for walkers/pedestrians.   Pls take action.

Subject: Help Help Help,..! Insufficient Rain Storm Water Drainage System & Improper Cleaning of Rain Storm Water Drainage Systems.

Requirement: New Extra Rain Storm Water Drainage Construction.

Respected Sir / Mam, I'm Kannan Madhavan R from Thirupugazh Street, Kamatchi Nagar, Valasaravakkam, Chennai, Tamil Nadu - 600087.

Previously Me & Several People have raised several Online & Offline Complaints in Chennai Corporation, CM Cell, CMWSSB, CPGRAMS regarding Water Stagnation since June 2022 at Thirupugazh Street (Zone-11, Division-152) due to Insufficient Rain Storm Water Drainages, & Improper Cleaning of Rain Storm Drainages (Improper Desilting of Rain Storm Water Drainages), & still No satisfactory Actions taken by any Government Official.

ie., In today's conditions Updated Systems of Rain Water Drainages are meant to be Built 10 Meters once as per the New GCC & TN Government Rules & Regulations, But in above Street, & Area it's not the scenario,.!

Many of our Neighborhood Houses are on the Lower Level of the Ground Floor.

We suffered due to Water Stagnation during 2015, 2018, 2019, 2021, & 2022 Monsoon Seasons because of Insufficient Rain Storm Water Drainages, & Improper Cleaning of Rain Storm Drainages.

The Water Stagnation led to Floods in most of Our Houses & Destroyed most of Our Valuable Items.

The Water Stagnation / Floods in our Houses also caused Deadly Hazardous Infectious Diseases (Malaria, Chikungunya, etc).

I have attached the Recent Image shot at 20th, July, 2023 of Small Water Stagnation when taken after the Improper Delayed Water Draining due to Insufficient Rain Storm Drainages & Improper Cleaning of Rain Storm Drainages.

Actually ir-regardless of the Image attached in this Mail, the Floods were Extreme in Heavy Rains, & Heavy Water Stagnation occurred.

As per my knowledge in Thirupugazh Street, Kamatchi Nagar, Valasaravakkam, now totally there are only 6 Rain Storm Water Drainage Systems are there, which is really Not Enough to Drain the Rain Water during Small Downpour Floods, Whereas the Adjacent Parallel Vysar Street etc in Kamatchi Nagar (Same Area) in Valasaravakkam has 10-11 Rain Storm Water Drainages.

Hence on behalf of all the Thirupugazh Street Neighbors, Please I kindly request you to help us all by Constructing at least some more Extra 5 Rain Storm Water Drainages & Properly Clean all the Storm Water Drainages over there.

Thank You in Advance. 

Yours Faithfully, 
Kannan Madhavan R

Location: Moore street (after mooker nalla muthu st) There is a particular scrap dealer and water bottle dealer who are using the foothpath and also a section of the road to store their wares. Even on requesting them they dont remove it. This street is prone to water stagnation and becomes difficult to walk on water puddles as the footpath is not accessible due to these shops. They outright refuse to move and ask us to walk on the street. I have placed a complaint on 1913 with GCC. Request the residents also to be proactive and take action

Hi GCC, This related to street lights not functioning in Water Canal Road in Korratur Area.

Due to non working of street lights the area is completely dark and roads are not visible for pedestrians and its also not safe since the darkness invites unwanted problems.

Am a resident of Lancor Central Park South, Elcot Avenue, Sholinganallur. The drainage outside of our apartment is open for the last 15 days.

I am writing to express my deep concern and frustration regarding the persistent issue of a non-functioning street light in our neighborhood. It has been brought to the attention of the respective EB office and GCC customer care on multiple occasions over the past five months, yet the problem remains unresolved. This poses a serious safety risk, especially during the dark hours, and has caused distress among the residents.

I kindly request an urgent intervention to rectify this matter as soon as possible. Adequate street lighting is essential for the well-being and security of our community. Your immediate attention to this issue would be greatly appreciated.

Note; Anna Street, mettu colony Manapakkam Chennai 125
Request you to please check this.  This place is having low light and has become a place of public defecation. This place extremely smelly and puts us in great risk of infections. Women are unable use the road and the road has become a place prone

pl don't wait for a horrific incident with stray dogs to take action. Stray dogs outnumber in these area due to the huge population around markets. Attacks happen especially in night.

Need to remove abandoned vehicle
Hello. I want to bring an issue to your notice. There is construction going on in my street, and all the other waste is not disposed of properly. All the rubbish is just thrown in the road, which makes it hard for bikes to come and go. And also, due to drainage issues, people of a few households residence have tried to increase the level of the road with the help of building scrap materials. It is hard for people to use the street. I request you to kindly take action for the welfare of the residents. I have attached pictures below for your reference.
it’s been 2 months since the road is been scrapped no signs of laying road in Royapettah area , Rathinam street . Elders & kids have fallen down while driving ? Can any1 help

One of the prime roads in #Choolaimedu connecting to multiple schools and residential areas has been this way.Stormwater drainage pits halfdug, JCB cranes stranded. Huge compromise on the safety of school children.Of course we are all tuned to 'adjust and keep moving' until we get stuck one day!! #Choolaimedu Gandhi Road + Kamarajar Nagar junction
SWD done last year but still this situation prevails in City Link Road Adambakkam Pin code 600088 along with horrible road conditions. Highly accident prone. Nightmare for commuters.

Sir

Could you consider storm water drain for 12 Ganesh Nagar 1st Street Janaki Ram Colony Villivakkam Chennai 600049?
This is a dead end and the water gets logged in front of my house as it is the last house.
Also there is some resistance from other association members but the water gets logged mainly in front of my house. 
Some residents are doing unnecessary works such as increasing the road height on their side of the road , putting a hole in the road to have the rain water from the road to go into the drainage etc. 

This falls under CM constituency and any help in this regard would be greatly appreciated as all other streets have storm water drains 

Thanking you

This is the status of our street today, sewage water flowing out and mixed with rain water which is not draining properly. Very bad smell and a great threat to residents of water and vector borne diseases. This is happening despite repeated complaints. Will GCC and their officials act before it poses a health hazard???
This is in Navaneethamal Street, Saligramam, near TNEB office. Past four years this road is been dug continuously by the EB and recently re laid road again dug up. With monsoon around the corner, pls help to patch it well and make sure the EB department doesnt mess up again. Thanks

Patch work on the pedestrians walkway is under progress.  Instead of changing the entire paving blocks, we noticed that only the damaged blocks were being replaced with the tiles. Got to speak to the contract workers and were informed that the tender was issued only for patch work. Since nothing can be done at this stage, we have requested them to ensure the walkway surface is laid evenly. The damages were caused due to the movement of heavy trucks within the park to the Gas Agency. We have asked the workers to reduce the width of the path near the second gate to ensure minimal damage in the future. 
While we appreciate the efforts taken by the new contractor to restore the pathway, we are a little disappointed that only a cosmetic makeover is being delivered once again.  There are several issues within the park which we have highlighted through the main stream, social and digital media which remain unattended. We hope the concerned officials will take our petitions seriously and address the issues in a time bound manner. Thank you.

This incident could have been averted had GCC taken timely action on the complaints about the stray cattle menace. Even now, Nanganallur Zone-12 Ward 165 is full of stray cattles roaming freely posing serious threat to public. Please do take action before any untoward incident.

Hello Sir , Good afternoon. Sorry to ping you on Instagram for a complaint .

I’m Premnath , secretary of Elegants Pinnacle apartment located at Nookampalayam Link Road , Semmanchery(zone 15, ward 200).

I have been raising complaints (2023-690PPP AND 2023-980CCJ) on the gcc portal to get an osr park cleaned and replace broken play equipment from June 2023 but GCC officials are closing the ticket without actioning on the fault .

Because of the fallen dry decomposed leaves and garbage thrown by the visitors , park has become a breeding place for mosquitoes and also we see snakes moving around everyday . 

As the ticket gets moved around 4-5 times , I don’t even have the option to reopen the ticket .

With dengue spreading around and dangers of snake bite, I humbly request you to instruct the officials to look at the issue on priority and get it resolved and stop the practice of closing tickets without actually resolving the issue ..
Thnx , Premnath 9884347066

Despite our requests to her to adapt them and feed them inside her compound, she remains adamant in the name of Blue Cross, etc (Her association with Blue Cross is not a license to assault on public hygiene and Safety of the common public.

Dear Sir/ Mam, thanks and appreciate the road relaying work that's been in progress at several areas. I sincerely request you all to also cross check the heights of speed bumps and mark the same. The heights vary randomly (which are hitting the belly of the four wheelers) and the non marking of the same is causing the motorist a lot of discomfort and danger. Sincerely requesting this and trust this will be taken care.

This is to bring to your notice that the storm water drains along 2nd street, TNHB colony, Korattur (especially near Korattur Sports Ground) are fully blocked with garbage and fallen leaves. This is posing a problem during the heavy rains as the rainwater is unable to drain into the drainage.. currently this is causing water stagnation, but now since the monsoon heavy rains have started, this may overflow and flood into the surrounding homes. Hence, I am kindly requesting to the concerned officials to take necessary action as soon as possible to prevent flooding during the rainy seasons and prevent loss and damage of property.. Kindly consider our request as we have elderly persons as well as small children at home.. thank you..
This is to inform you that these Garbage containers in Anna nedumpadhai perpendicular to gill nagar 2nd and third street, Choolaimedu (opposite to Muthu Medicals )is causing lot of traffic during peak times and people couldn't walk across it and find it more difficult since it's taking the road space vehicles are getting jammed.

Complaint
Respected Sir/Madam,
I wish to report an ongoing issue where groups of individuals are consuming alcohol in public spaces near Muthamil Nagar, specifically the FES School back entrance and near to the Metro Water and Sewage Water Treatment Plant, Chennai 600118. This is causing significant difficulties for women who are trying to access garbage collection areas. Additionally, empty bottles and used glass are being left in the same locations. These incidents occur regularly during late office working hours and on weekends. I kindly request that appropriate action be taken to address this matter.

We received the quoted  complaint from one of the residents of Rajabhathar Street, Ward 71, Zone 6, Perambur this morning and were shocked to note that a road which was resurfaced months ago has been dug up to lay a Sewage pipe.  
"Namaskarangal
How are you.All good?
Again construction for drainage connection from school
is going on. It's given on contract.
Already water from the street beginning is coming down to our house.please if you are free kindly have a look.
Councillor is coming here it seems. Very very sorry to disturb you
Thank you so much.
Very kind of you.
🙏🙏"
Here below is a copy of the petition filed by them with Chennai Metro Water 
"This is from Rajabather street Perambur Chennai 11 ward 71. Construction of drainage connection is going on from adjacent school road from corporation school. No rule is permitted to give connection from ward to another ward. Though the connection is not permitted under rules   the connection is being given. It's submitted for you sir being happened to be girls 'school  it's possible to arise blockage of drainage. Now we request you to kindly put a filter from the school side and then the connection can be given. As the work is going on your immediate action is solicited for fruitful action.
Thank you Sir"
We have been closely  engaging with the officials in both CMWSSB and GCC for years and had anticipated such issues and requested your predecessor Mrs. Vaidehi as well as AE Mr. Aurangzeb to replace or lay any new pipes before the road was resurfaced. Several stories have been published about the issues faced by the residents living in this street.
Here are a few links for your reference:
https://www.dtnext.in/.../damaged-drain-lines-bother...
https://chennai.citizenmatters.in/chennai-roads-gcc-tneb...
All our efforts to keep our roads free from potholes and road cuts have failed miserably due to the lackadisical attitude of the officials and workers. But for your timely intervention this road would have been dug up a few weeks ago. If you recall I had personally called you when we noticed the CMWSSB workers digging a pit next to the School. We were happy when the work was abandoned after plugging the damaged pipeline. 
I got to speak to Mr. Aurangzeb a while ago. I am told that the road cut and new sewage pipe connection work from the Corporation Girls School is now being handled by the Greater Chennai Corporation  officials and the local elected representative. He was saying the road would be restored properly with a BT patch work once the pipe are laid. 
Coordination between the various government agencies has been lacking and therefore the active members of Perambur Neighborhood Development Forum  have been working closely with the local officials from the various agencies only to bridge the gaps.
If CMWSSB had managed to replace the damaged pipes and addressed our other concerns before the road was resurfaced, we wouldn't be having this conversation now. 
Hope lessons will be learnt and we will get to see some positive changes going forward.

GA ROAD, 7&8th lane. More than 2 months roads which were very usable were dug up and till date is just there with debris and stones. Due to the road uneven leveling we see manhole sewage leak occurring often,temporary Solutions of covering the leak with gravel have been going on for many times now. Will the roads be laid or not? Or is the tender amount just gone out of the window? How long the people should wait for this irresponsible work from the officials. Can you do dug up a road even for A couple of days like this in the path of @CMOTamilnadu or any other minister's daily routes? WE DARE YOU. That'll never happen, only humble citizens are taken for a ride. Shameful act. These all massacres the face of THE RULING PARTY

Sir why this show off when common man is suffering with bad roads, storm water, etc. We pay taxes not for F1 but basic amenities, when do you plan to prioritise critical issues over trivial matters ? 
Dear Sir/Madam.. Could you please look into below building plan approval issue? Please note that Chennai corporation commissioner approved the layout. Now rejecting building plan approval stating layout deviation. It is not fair
I am writing to bring to your attention a matter of significant concern regarding the recent road construction in Ward 152, Zone 11 of the Greater Chennai Corporation. The contractors responsible for laying the roads in Majestic Colony Main Road, Chowdary Nagar Main Road, Chowdary Nagar 5th Street, and Kaikankuppam VOC Street have failed to adhere to proper milling procedures, resulting in severe issues and inconvenience for the residents of the area.

The negligence of the contractor and the assistant engineer from Zone 11 has led to water stagnation on Majestic Colony Main Road, Chowdary Nagar Main Road, and Chowdary Nagar 5th Street during recent rains. This situation has arisen due to the uneven road surface and the sudden appearance of multiple potholes in Kaikankuppam VOC Street, all attributable to substandard asphalt surfacing. It has come to my attention that the hasty road construction was initiated without milling, as the contractor prioritized meeting deadlines over ensuring the quality of work. This decision was allegedly influenced by the impending visit of the Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu to the area.

I believe that the assistant engineer of Zone 11 failed to exercise due diligence in verifying the work carried out by the contractor, presumably for personal gains. This lapse has resulted in a compromised road infrastructure that is now causing inconvenience and potential harm to the residents of the area.

I kindly request that you take immediate action to address the following concerns:

Direct the Assistant Engineer of Zone 11 to expedite the resolution of the road problems in Majestic Colony Main Road, Chowdary Nagar Main Road, Chowdary Nagar 5th Street, and Kaikankuppam VOC Street.

Initiate a thorough investigation into the conduct of the contractor responsible for the road construction in Ward 152, Zone 11, and take necessary actions as per the terms of the contract.

Conduct a review of the actions of the Assistant Engineer of Zone 11, and if found guilty of negligence, take appropriate disciplinary measures.

It is crucial that the Greater Chennai Corporation ensures the well-being and safety of its residents by maintaining the integrity of its infrastructure. I trust that prompt action on your part will alleviate the current issues and prevent similar occurrences in the future.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to a swift resolution and improvement in the road conditions for the residents of Ward 152, Zone 11.
We found one more open silt catch pit in the same stretch of 1st Avenue Road, Ashok Nagar. It would be of great help if the local officials could please monitor the condition of the pits on a routine basis and fix it well in time. Safety of the pedestrian and commuter

Dear Greater Chennai Corporation,

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to bring to your attention some pressing concerns in the Hindi Pracha Saba Street of Chennai that require urgent intervention.

Firstly, there is a significant issue with construction debris that has been left unattended on the road nex to Dindugal Thalapakkit Restaurant in Hindi pracha saba street. This not only obstructs the smooth movement of pedestrians and vehicles but also poses a potential safety hazard. The accumulation of debris is not only an eyesore but also a detriment to the overall well-being of the community. I kindly request your immediate attention to this matter and urge you to take swift action in clearing the construction debris from the area.

Secondly, there is a concerning situation related to water used for washing in the Dindugal Thalapakkit Restaurant in Hindi pracha saba street that is accumulating on the road. This stagnant water has become a breeding ground for mosquitoes and is emitting an unpleasant odor. Given the recent surge in dengue infections, this stagnant water source poses a serious health risk to the community. I implore you to address this issue promptly to ensure the well-being of residents and to prevent the further spread of disease.

I have attached two photos to this message to visually highlight the severity of these issues. Your swift action in resolving these concerns will undoubtedly contribute to the overall improvement of our community's safety and well-being.

Thank you for your immediate attention to these matters. I trust that Greater Chennai Corporation is committed to maintaining a safe and healthy environment for all residents in Chennai.
Sir, the roads which were recently filled with Concrete have caved in after the second spell of rains. Things are again back to square one. Pls find us a sustainable solution. Hopeful of your intervention. This is Dr. Ambedkar Salai in Madipakkam.

Raised the complaint through helpline on 17 November (complaint on Street Dogs with complaint Number 2023-305LBD). When I called, they said it is closed. Irresponsible from Zone 14 officials. Complaints are just for namesake it seems. Please take necessary action

Respected Chennai corporation this is nyniappa Naicken street corner connecting aaya Pillai street and center of Ayya pilla street it's been more than 3 days. Streets are dirty and polluted. People loo and shit on streets. It's very difficult to breathe and walk on the street Kindly check and solve the issue.

, I wish to bring it to your notice that my request for clearing the garbage from Barnaby Avenue,kilpauk opposite to my house is still not cleared being 5th day today inspite of requesting several times to zonal officer 8 and CI. Kindly clear garbage.
Tree trimming of branches which hide the street lights, no corporation supervision and the boys who have come sitting around and not doing diligent work. Worst. All our tax money down the drain.
Sir no action taken to relay road under bridge in Moolakadai and in very bad state. This is right from last 8 months or more. Also Moolakadai to Kodungaiyur, road is fully occupied with autos,shops’s vehicle. Reported this too few months ago but no action.

Result of poor coordination btw 
@chennaicorp
 & contractors path btw road & SWD was damaged for laying road. However only n some parts road was laid: now water stagnates & loose soil contributes 2 slippery roads
When this road will be laid in mkb nagar. Why work happening only at specific places?
Anna Nagar 5th avenue was stripped for road laying 2-3 months back and the road is extremely poor and dangerous for bikes to drive on. 
. There are huge pot holes in the Junction leading to 2nd Avenue.
there are so many dogs which has been a threat to children and people passing by . Catching the dogs and leaving them again at the same area will not serve the purpose. Stray dogs should be maintained separately.
it is really hard for walkers in #GandhiNagar #Adyar with dog walkers spoiling all pavements & roads with dog poop making it impossible to walk. 
Sir lot of stray dogs near Parthsarathy temple triplicane please look into it

Hi , you have raised the complaint number 2023-495MOQ on behalf of me. Still issue not fixed.Pls refer the enclosed video for a better understanding of the current road status. MINOR FIX, BUT WILL HELP A LOT.
This road and the entire area has been milled two months ago and not been relaid. Even before monsoons came. So what do you have to say to this? Will you take immediate action with proper scientifically laid roads and proper drain slopes? My car got punctured twice travelling over this. Karpagam Avenue  opposite MRC Nagar. If a politician was staying here I wouldn’t have to beg you. 

This is what a pack of stray dogs in Kodambakkam had done to a cat that had just given birth to its kitten. I saw them tear the cat open from every side n kill it. I chased them away which was dangerous too. Had this been a young kid or a baby it would've been fatal.

This Car shed an encroachment on public road, blocking access to 4 houses at Mahatma Gandhi, 1st cross, Karapakkam, Ward 198, Zone 15. Request #GCC to remove encroachment and lay the road immediately. 
Please fix this road. Its there past 4 months.sathyamurthy nagar main road, vyasarpadi. This road full of dangerous pot holes

This is corporation road, Perungudi. Pathetic, even after multiple complaints and escalations no action taken till date.
Garbage dumped at this place again.
They sat at the beach, and on Sundays, they charge almost 200 rupees for four-wheelers. Can the cost be lowered? Last week, it was 200rs; on 28th Oct, it was 80rs. They don't ask how long we'll be at the beach; they decide the time themselves.
Drainage leaking for years and bad  smell in and around the area #Velachery 100 ft road .Near Titan showroom, Maybell . No one cares
Despite complaining many times, there are many street dogs at Soundarya Nagar (dn 34) and Subramani Garden Extn & Rekha nagar (dn 27). They close complaints without proper remedy.

#Chennai Government if filled with ROWDY bribe eating goons who are ready to kill anyone for Money.
This is how they a fill a pot hole in 📍Sowcarpet, Chennai.
CHENNAI CORPORATION IS FILLED WITH ROWDY GOONS, chennai government is ready to kill everyone in sowcarpet and threatening people to mind thier work and drive thier vehicle over the bricks, so it levels!!
Need to appreciate @chennaicorp for creating artificial waterfalls in Chennai city
The students and parents have demanded that the government should take immediate action to drain the rainwater and prevent it from stagnating here again.

None of them are having signals to contact and I can be the point of contact for the same.
The rain water is stagnant for the past three days and it’s almost fourth day. The stagnant water let alone is greater problem and the power is out for four days since Sunday to be precise. Almost all the surrounding areas have electricity and the water has flown out except for us. Our Chellappa street on the whole has been out of power whereas the surrounding areas have been given power as of 6th December evening. We have already filed multiple complaints and no action is taken as of now. The picture of my car and the surrounding water was taken today morning and the water level has not even reduced a single inch.
For the past 3 days there is no power in Kodungaiyur MKB Nagar. The water is fully clogged above the knee. None of them came forward to help us. Even for basic needs like drinking water we are walking around 1 km. No rescue teams nothing. So many people are suffering without food. Kindly someone take initiative and do the needful. Also, none of the news is talking about our area so sad to hear this

Kudos. A garbage pile is there near Ward 147 councillor office along with water stagnation. High chances of mosquito breeding. Also Street lights are not functioning in Vivekanandar Street. Please look into this.
The condition of road with sewage mixed.please take action immediately. Many streets are like this with sewage leakage garbages everywhere.
Korattur Subway looks indifferent. Could the concern be taken up with appropriate corporation? Plug out progress rate seems slower than evaporation. Commuters need to take 4+ kms extra to cross the railway line.

Already the road cut has been prohibited for 3 months due to monsoon and now due to this issue it is getting delayed again..

Hi! I’m a resident of Ashok Nagar. 
We live on the main road near Ashok pillar.. the corp. team came and dug up the front of our gates and left the work unfinished. The electrical wires are exposed, the sidewalk concrete is broken. And I have fallen off my bike 2 times trying to drive on top of the big electrical wires. Now this is also a hazard because the cars going on them is making the wires inside exposed. It’s a commercial cum residential building and I cannot control who comes and goes. Can you please take this as a request to finish this job ASAP. It’s ridiculous how it can be left like this. I’m on the main road right next to hotel gokulam park and Indian bank. Kindly share me a local coordinator number so I can ensure work can happen. It’s causing havoc in all our day to day lives. Thanks and hoping to hear back.

We are residents of 1st Lane, Nungambakkam High Road (Opposite Indian Oil Corporation building). We are thankful that the Chennai Corp had made our road concrete a few years back. However, there has been an error in road construction where the road is lower in one part which leads to slush and stagnant water every time. This leads to mosquitoes, diseases and an unhealthy and smelly surrounding.   We request to rectify this situation and increase the level of this small part of the road so that water will not stagnate every time.

Issue 2: There are illegal and unauthorised shops who are operating illegally and outside their allotted zone. This is attracting people to congregate to smoke and urinate and create an unhealthy environment. During lunch time also, there are unauthorised shops that come and sell food and go lead in to crowds who litter the street and wash the plates making the place smelly and slushy everyday.   We request to look into on this and help us.

Subject: Urgent Attention Needed: Potentially Infectious Dog on Campus

Dear Chennai Corporation Team,

I am writing to bring to your urgent attention the presence of a potentially infectious dog on our campus. I see that it is having disease and it smells badly when it passes by.

I am concerned that this dog may pose a health risk to the campus community, especially individuals who are susceptible to animal-borne illnesses.

I kindly request you to look into this matter immediately and take appropriate action to ensure the safety of everyone on campus. This may involve capturing the dog and contacting animal control.
Got to see SWD constructed with slabs which can be removed to facilitate desilting before the rains. 

Wondering why this is not being implemented across the city uniformly.

Respected Sir, I was bitten by a stray dog yesterday. When I went to Velachery PHC to get my ARV shots, I was told they were not available and told to go to Adyar UCHC. In Adyar UCHC, there was no Medical Officer to prescribe them., And the nurse would not provide ARV shots without MO's prescription. Due to this, I had to go for private health care. You don't control the stray dog population in Chennai. And don't provide ARV shots as well if someone gets bitten., If people have to go for private health care for stray dog bites, why do we even pay taxes? The Minister made false claims in the Assembly that ARV is available in all TN PHCs. That's just not true. Please take appropriate action.

Finally you guys managed to lay stones after following up for more than 6months now. How long the road will be like this before laying tar. 
ரோடு முழுவதும் பள்ளங்கள் உள்ளது. மெட்ரோ வாட்டர் நோண்டி போட்டு அப்படியே விட்டாங்களா. பள்ளங்கள் patch செய்யப்படுமா? ஆல் இந்தியா ரேடியோவில் இருந்து MRC நகர் வரை பள்ளங்கள் உள்ளது.
This is the sight at heart of the city Kathipara towards butt road debris on the road for last 2 weeks, thousands of school kids take this road, stones scattered everywhere pls take action  b4 any accident.

As you enter the road from Thiruvallur street on your right side you can see the manholes are open and it is like that for more than years. Thanks once again
lake also heavily being encroached year by year. Every year authorities come, issue notice to encroachers and leave. That's it
urgent attention needed! Ambulances and fire service vehicles struggle on this encroached road. Your prompt action required.
This has been a long standing problem. Don't know when you are going to address it
This path is in the same condition for past 2 months. Vehicles are getting damage and few elder people were also fell down. Even walking in this path is difficult. 
 roads are milled before 5 months in mkb nagar. 7th and 8th main road. This is new guinness record. When this road going to be laid? Election also nearing.

when this road will be laid? Continuously roads are milled but why there is delay to relay it?

Regarding road cleanliness post by you, I bring to your kind attention that garbage and cleaning activities is not upto to the standard in DIV 116. WARD 9 around Parthasarathy Koil Temple Tank Area. It was notified to the Urbarser supervisor several times but nothing works. If we call them and tell they will do for the day. But no effective supervision.   It is very regretful on the part of Chennai corporation that still you are not willing to learn or reluctant to learn lesson on the stray cattle menace here in triplicane around Parthasarathy Koil Temple Tank Area. Needless to say that you are aware of it and also the owner Narayanan, responsible and out of your due diligence of not to help public the situation is getting worse and it made us to think differently.

Subject: Urgent: Immediate Action Required to Address my concern. I am writing to bring to your immediate attention an urgent matter concerning the road which got spoiled by Aparatement builder recently.It appears that the road has been dug up for some maintenance or construction work, but regrettably, it has been left unclosed and incomplete. This situation has persisted for 25 days creating significant inconvenience and potential safety hazards for the residents. The unclosed road poses a danger to both pedestrians and vehicles, especially during nighttime when visibility is low. Additionally, the disruption caused by this incomplete work is affecting our daily routines and overall quality of life. Given the seriousness of the situation, I kindly request that you take immediate action to address this issue. It is imperative that the road be properly closed and the work completed as soon as possible to ensure the safety and well-being of all residents. Please provide an update on the steps being taken to resolve this matter and an estimated timeline for completion. Your prompt attention to this issue will be greatly appreciated by all affected residents.

Also the slum area make the road too difficult to travel as well due to unwanted attention from men. What can I do to change this?

Fire accident from the garbage dump at Ram nagar 13th Street eastern end and Velachery fire station team was summoned to come and put it off! This ongoing issue needs to be addressed very seriously at least now!

This has become an everyday scenario in Royapuram. Two days back, 4-5 street dogs barged into our quarters and damaged a car. Now, this one. Also the stray street dogs are killing cats which are pets. Can we expect some Swift action so that the situation doesn't escalate any further than this. Property damage is fine, but what if it's a physical damage to a human being? I hope the @chennaicorp will take Swift action and sort out this issue at the earliest.

Large gap in pavement in front of recently constructed building. Left open without any manhole or barricade. Big danger for anyone especially children and animals. Kindly act immediately before any untoward incident happens.
platform encroachment at Bharathi salai Royapettah. Today road trench and looks like illegal metro water connection. Is it with the help of local corporation AE. Why no action? Can someone look into this matter.
The tree wastes, electric post fallen in cyclone is left in the street. Though the electric post may be made dummy but still it is harmful and someone could get hurt.
This is the state of affairs within the local administration in Ward 71, Zone 6, Perambur. Please take a close look at the dates in the photographs. Shoddy Cosmetic Makeover seems to be a money spinner for the local officials.

இங்கு தொடர்ந்து இதுபோன்று எந்தவித அனுமதியும் பெறாமல் கழிவுகளை கொட்டி வருகின்றார்கள். இதனால் அதிக துர்நாற்றம் இங்கு சுத்தி இருக்கும் பகுதி மக்களுக்கு வருகின்றது. அரசாங்க வழிகாட்டுதல் எதுவும் பின்பற்ற ப்படவில்லை இதனால் நோய் தொற்று அபாயம் தான் உள்ளது. மிகப்பெரிய தொழிற்சாலையில் செய்ய வேண்டிய பணிகளை திறந்த வழியில் சில சமூக விரோத நபர்களால் நடத்தப்படுகின்றது. சுகாதாரத்துறை உடனடியாக நடவடிக்கை எடுக்க வேண்டும் என்று கேட்டுக் கொள்கின்றேன்
this is on the 16th cross street Besant Nagar. The entire street is filled with alcohol bottles. Some clean up will be great.

Not only does @chennaicorp appear to have initiated any action yet despite identifying the location as requested, but the street has become a dumping ground for all sorts of filthy and trash!
Don't know if the steel rod handle on one side of the Pazhavanthangal pedestrian sub-way was deliberately removed as part of maintenance or stolen by someone! It was of immense help to the pedestrians, especially senior citizens and children alike! 😟
Drainage pit cover is broken and posing a danger to public at sai Ganesh nagar first main road, Jalladianpet.Plz rectify
This is the school where kids below the age of 5 spend 4-6 hours a day. This is how our @chennaicorp maintains it, yet they have failed to protect this area from garbage being thrown by nearby residents. Please take necessary action against those throwing garbage there.
it's been more than one month, in Mogappair Kongu nagar in front of sonex Supriya Apartment. Digged road is not closed. Many Children are going to school and difficult for vehicles to cross. Pl take immediate action.
Haha. Ji in Thiyagi satya Murthy nagar, no storm water drainage. For namesake it's done for 100 meters in main street. So d question is why no money alloted. If alloted who took it? Why no work. @chennaicorp is silent on this for over a year. Good governance. Lol.
Pavement illegally demarcated& encroachd by LalithaJewellery@ Thirumangalam MetroStation(Juntn of 13thMainRoad&AnnaNagar 2nd Avenue)causing hindrance to Metro users&pedestrians,forced to walk on the road that may lead to risk🙄
remove the flex banners at Arasa maram Junction in Ramapuram Z11, Dn155. Your swift action is highly appreciated!

it’s time we ban plastics shops in #BeasantNagar beach. People are just dumping the place with so much plastic the Mother Earth and Nature is not going to forgive us. Neither people or the shop owners are matured enough to self govern usage. Shop Keepers end of the day are dumping the waste inside sea. I asked the guy why don’t you throw it out he coolly said sea will take it.

Corporation removed garbage bins in sarathynagar Velachery. But asks citizens to keep green and blue bins or hand over garbage to the sanitary staff. Both are unfeasible. garbage is strewn all over. Corporation should listen to public & keep bins in the area.

Why can’t even the richest part of the Koyambedu market be managed properly by the shop vendors. 😑 All the shops have huge cold storage facilities but can’t maintain the shop front. @chennaicorp you can collect soo much fine from them.

Garbage not collected for last 3 days in residences on R BLOCK 16TH STREET ANNA NAGAR. This person employed is a repeat offender and picks it once in 3 days.

Kindly remove the unauthorized sales tent on Bharathi Salai in Ramapuram (Dn155 Z11, near Amma canteens & Opp. Housing board)? It has been ongoing for more than a year.
Yesterday night at Thanikachalam Road in T Nagar in #chennai. I was about to fall inside in this open pit. Open silt catch pit over the saucer drain. What if someone falls down into it with southwest rains pouring? The footpaths also have encroachments which will push pedestrians to the road, risking them to fall here. 
But, but no one is taking the dried leaves from the road outside my house. The GCC is clearing leaves from roads everywhere except my plot. Why. I am also paying property and metro tax as everyone does but why only my road side leaves not removed.
Nice, but in many areas of Ward 155, the bags filled with solid waste have not been removed.
Footpath Encroachment :

In fhe above mentioned road there is always water staggnation even for small rain.

Again, despite numerous forwards to AEE/EE/ZO, no action by GCC on illegal constructions. 6 months of grievances. GND floor had safe clearances, but 2 floors added dangerously close to EHT lines. No setback, stability issues& no approved plans displayed. Immediate action needed!

manali, thiruvenkadam street digged up for metrowater pipe laying. Elders are difficult to walk after the rains. Difficult to drive the vehicles. When this road will be laid? Whats the delay to lay the road if the work completed.
suryanarayana chetty street, royapuram road fully damaged because of metrowater work. Its very difficult to drive in this road. Vehicles are skidding. Atleast fix the road where the work is completed.
Even for a small rain this Vembulisubedar Street, ALANDUR at the entrance from GST ROAD, the road is flooded with rain water. Irony is that there is a storm water drain which has no flow drain to the river. THE SDW IS FULL OF DEBRIS. NO DESILTING DONE.
Respected sir/madam, can I kindly request your support to review the road damage infront of  Velachery Grand mall, this can help ease the traffic condition.

It's been over a week since they built the drainage collection tank, but they forgot to remove the dug-up sand, blocking our vehicle access. Despite multiple requests, no action has been taken. The supervisor seems unresponsive. Our street, a dead end, remains the only one uncleared, leaving us without an alternate route for emergencies. Your website throws error while submitting the complaint. When called 1913 it says "you are not allowed to call this number". I tried all my best to reach you.
Div 58 where the greater chennai corporation head quarters is located is in worst condition no distilling no maintains
Uncleared garbage on  road at lakshmiammal street ayyavoo colony aminjikarai, will chennai corp act?
Hi Team, I have been raising complaint so many times but no response. Kindly look into this with priority. I request CCG to do something on water stagnant. Even if there is a rain for 5minutes, water does not flow and it is stagnant. Due to this, we have mosquitoes and insects at home and we are unable to go for work. Please request to solve this issue of water stagnant as soon as possible. Thanku
Worse situation of roads in Nerkundram Sivanthi Avenue for the past few years now. Much worse inner roads. We have been suffering with unimaginable dust and sand because of this. Requesting you to kindly take swift action to lay the road here.
Please check ward number 188 Madipakkam... The garbage is all around the streets.(Is Door-to-Door waste collection by GCC convenient for you? Our dedicated conservancy workers pick up waste right from your doorstep, making it easy for you to contribute to a cleaner and greener)
People are turning it into dump yard. And this every day situation, Corporation people come clean this every day, And again the public does same mess next day. You need to remove this box from here and start putting fine to people. The corporation staff works so hard every day, And every other day people make the same mess, They have converted this into a dump yard, Please remove this box from here, It also creates traffic everyday
Yes, but the rubbish bins are always over flowing and cattle and dogs pull out the stuff, dumping it on the road. The place is a mess and is always stinking. Please check out Madipakkam Ram Nagar at the intersection with Ramalinganagar extn
We haven't seen any fogging being done in our neighborhoods, Venkatraman Street, Saraswathi Square, Venkatraman Canal Street, Ward 71, Zone 6.(Anti-mosquito fogging)
(#GCC is developing the Lokmanya Tilak Park)
In Singanna Street, Chintadripet Ward62 we are requesting for D2D collection for the past 2years...but, no response. Kept one bin for the entire road next to transformer.. everytime it's over flowing. Kindly start D2D collection and remove the bin to make transformer zone clean.
Flag post precariously protruding on the road, will action be taken to fix it before something untoward happens?

You should clear the silt which is taken out from the sediment pits immediately. In Anna Nagar, the silt was dumped near the sediment pit and with the heavy rain today everything went into the pit again. What is the use of desilting when the concerned authorities don’t even supervise this work? Waste of money!

Sir,
The problem exists since inaguration. 
Faulty design, insufficient UG Drain network.
Huge bottleneck during rain.

Who owns Kathipata flyover? @nhai or State Highways?
Why can't they coordinate with @chennaicorp @RAKRI1 and resolve once for a all.
To clarify, there are two issues
1) A big, round depression in the road
2) Manhole covers sinking below road surface.
Possibly, both are due to heavy traffic diversion (for cmrl work) flowing through the junction.
Kindly discuss who needs to fix which one and get both fixed 🙂

Bins are empty or dumped nearby in a dilapidated condition. The bins which are no longer used should be recycled, which is not the case. We urge GCC to conduct an audit to check how many bins within the city are no longer used and arrange to have them recycled. This is the situation next to Perambur Loco Works Station on Loco Scheme Road diagonally opposite the Amma Unavagam and GCC Playground in Ward 67, Zone 6. These garbage and debris have not been dumped on the road by the residents but by the conservancy workers. What action will be taken to fix this issue in public interest
The plight of the silt catch pits across Perambur, Ward 71, Zone 6 deserves to be seen to believe. Hope the local AE will take note of our concerns and address it immediately - Kumaraswamy Street, Chennaiyyan New Colony 1st and 2nd Main Road, Bharathi Road, JJ Scheme Road, Vadivelu Main Road, Nelvayal Road and Perambur High Road. There are no silt catch pits or even the exposed manhole chambers doors which can be opened and desilted on Patel Road and Venkatraman Street.

Sir ...Pl ensure you clear the illegal eatery present next to garbage . The issue is mainly from them,  as they throw balance sambar and chutney s keeping this area shabby.
This menace is happening throughout the city.

For instance please visit Kodambakkam Station View Road. The entire road is encroached by something or the other resulting in heavy traffic jam.

Railway commuters have a tough time walking on the street as footpaths are encroached.

In Chennai there is an area called Madipakkam.. Ever heard of it and it's road conditions.. Despite multiple complaints the condition of road is so bad that daily there are accidents.. Will it take a deadly accident for authorities to repair and relay the roads?
Madipakkam Ramalinga nagar main road is always blocked between
6.30pm to 7.30pm by flocks of cows blocking the roads completely.
Chennai Corporation's efforts to evict illegal occupation of pavements in the city have been futile. One day they are removed, the next day they reappear in style! New encroachers have opened shops on P T Rajan Salai at K K Nagar.

I am raising a complaint against the garbage cleaners.
Around morning time, most of the people not roaming on the roads because ladies are making and preparing foods for her childrens and husband. In that time, Garbage vehicle came and collect gatbages from the home. Now the complaint is, how people know that the garbage vehicle is waiting outside for us when people are isolated inside the house? In that case, gcc implements a music.
During garbage collection, the GCC Garbage cleaner must play the alert music on the vehicle, if music plays people inside the houses understands that garbage cleaner is coming or waiting outside. In Valasaravakkam, Ambedkar Salai, The Garbage cleaner not at all playing music in the vehicle. Most of the people not dumping her houshold wastes. They stagnates and waits ro dump thier houshold wastes on the next day. Whose mistake is this? And also, the Garbage

daily accident happening coz of dat damaged rain water canal manhole
Team, Request you to clear this vehicle from the street. This has become a public toilet spot. If some other vehicle is parked adjacent to it on the road, it is completely hidden and used as toilet. Please help making it better. 

The newly cemented drainage cap on Mount Road near Workafella, #Teynampet is poorly marked. Only stones and a plastic tray are used to warn motorists, posing a serious hazard to two-wheeler riders. Please take immediate action to ensure proper safety measures are in place to prevent accidents.
Trees are blocking the pavement and water is getting stagnated even with slight showers, forcing the people to walk in the middle of the road.
Basin Bridge to Mint ! The entire bridge is chaotic and huge traffic snarls happen everyday. 

Ambulances get struck as the junction is choked by motorists driving on the wrong side, share autos stopping anywhere and a U turn is given near the wall tax road junction. Unplanned.
The road in the subway in nanganallur near alandur court is damaged

The adjoining mkn road is also damaged due to some civic body works
